# SmartHire

## Prompt
We attempt to match suitable applicants for a job description automatically and unbiasedly. To achieve such goal, we develop a web application that can read and extract contents from resumes and job description and then use Word2Vec model to evaluate the "distance" between the candidate's qualifications and the job's requirements. We will then rank and score candidates and recommend the top candidates to recruiters.
