    "## Matching Job Description and Resume with Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a famous natural language processing model by Stanford and Google (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). The idea is a word's definition can be defined by when it appears in a context and by the surrounding words that usually come with it. In this notebook, we try to make use of the pretrained Word2Vec model (a very well-trained model by Google) to learn how a candidate's qualifications match with the job description\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use IBM's Natural Language Understanding API to extract keywords and concepts from a job description and resumes, then we apply our Word2Vec model to measure the \"distance\" between the qualifications of the candidates and the requirements of the resumes. "

I believe, if we efficiently extract content from a resume, the matching algorithm with Word2Vec can perform very well"
